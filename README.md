# Cross Course Project

![image](/images/logo.png)

## Description

Square Eyes is a video streaming website where you can purchase high-quality videos. The cross course project began with creating a high-fidelity interactive prototype of the design. Afterwards I created a properly functioning, responsive website with HTML and CSS based on the prototype I designed. Later on I used JavaScript to modify the project to fetch products from an external API, and completed the project by testing the usability with Hotjar.

These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.
