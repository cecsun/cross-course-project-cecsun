# Cross-Course Project

![image](/images/logo.png)

## Description

Square Eyes is a video streaming website where you can purchase high-quality videos. The cross course project began with creating a high-fidelity interactive prototype of the design. Afterwards I created a properly functioning, responsive website with HTML and CSS based on the prototype I designed. Later on I used JavaScript to modify the project to fetch products from an external API, and completed the project by testing the usability with Hotjar.
